# Soundboard
A C# WPF program that allows sounds to be stored and played through a microphone at the push of a button


### Notes

This is notes for later, when I finally make this readme useful

Packages: AutoFac + DI net version, NAudio
NAudio.Sdl2
EFCore.SQLite,Design,Tools
SystemDrawings?

To play through mic, need a virtual audio device. Will need a way for users to pick that out
/select audio devices besides picking thru 3rd party application (Voicemeeter)
